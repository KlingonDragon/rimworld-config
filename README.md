# Rimworld Config

- `rooms`: diagrams of room layouts at various sizes
  > I play a lot of mountain bases and often go with a regular grid. 
- `tools`: tools to help you when playing
  - `work_numbers`: Helps you prioritise work using numbers in the work tab by letting you move jobs around in a basic list. If you have mods that add/change jobs, you can add your own list of jobs in the `work_lists` folder.
